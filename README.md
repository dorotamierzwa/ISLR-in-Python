My attempts in Python to solve exercises from ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R"]
(http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) 

by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani.

**Disclaimer** - it's for learning purposes, so the exercises are likely to have better solutions than those here presented.
Will be updating the files in the process.
